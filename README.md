# SZL Sovereign OS

> Control before action. Evidence after.

The missing operator kernel for [szl-holdings](https://github.com/szl-holdings). One Python process. Five organs. Five verticals. Eleven category captures.

**Not a rehost.** vLLM, LangGraph, Llama Guard, Mosaic, Lattice, Guidewire, QuantConnect, Zillow, Sigstore, Electricity Maps, and UDS are *cited leaders of a job*. SZL takes the job, not the code.

## What it runs

| Surface | Honesty |
|---|---|
| Five-organ kernel (YACHAY / YUYAY / YAWAR / OTel / Khipu) | LIVE, fail-closed |
| Λ uniqueness | Conjecture 1 OPEN |
| Energy | UNAVAILABLE (never a fabricated joule) |
| Signing | STRUCTURAL-ONLY hash, not a signature |
| killinchu actuation | SIMULATED |
| Real estate occupancy | UNAVAILABLE |
| Hugging Face live push from this sandbox | ROADMAP until `HF_TOKEN` is in org secrets |

GitHub is canonical. A Hugging Face Space named `SZLHOLDINGS/szl-sovereign-os` is the intended runtime mirror (`sdk: docker`, port 7860). This README does not claim that Space is RUNNING until Hub readback says so.

## Verticals

- [a11oy](https://github.com/szl-holdings/a11oy) — inference
- [killinchu](https://github.com/szl-holdings/killinchu) — defense (SIMULATED actuation)
- [david-leads](https://github.com/szl-holdings/david-leads) — insurance, public data
- [szl-quant](https://github.com/szl-holdings/szl-quant) — paper-only
- [szl-real-estate](https://github.com/szl-holdings/szl-real-estate) — public PLUTO/ACS, not an MLS
